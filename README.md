# Intelligent-Vehicles Project Key Points

• Researched ‘Obstacle Avoiding’ and ‘Orientation Guiding’ for vehicle safety enhancement using
HBE-SMARTCAR platform and Android Studio.

• Conducted C++ programming to implemented the method of PWM Control and Track Projection.

• Improved the performance of tracking by 30% through optimizing the tracking algorithm.



# Abstract
In this project, obstacle avoidance and localization of car-like robot use separately the  ultrasonic ranging method and relative positioning method, through the field performance of car-like robot, the robot can accurately avoid obstacles and can complete self-positioning by analyzing several ultrasonic sensors data from car-like robot , this finally proved that the method and relative positioning method is correct.
